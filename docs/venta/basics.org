#+title: Venta - The Tangi package manager :: Basics

Venta is THE Tangi package manager.

* Getting started
So, at the root of your project, you will have a file called ~Venta.tn~.
You may notice the file extension being ~.tn~. That is because ~Venta.tn~ is a build script.
This build script, in particular, has superpowers.

This is an example build script:
#+begin_example tangi
const package: venta.Package = .{
    .name = "myapp",
    .version = "0.0.1a",
    // .root = "src/main.tn", // it is added by default, so no need to worry about that
    // .kind = .app, // also added by default
    // .kind = .lib, // if you want a library, set this to .lib
};
fn main(builder: &mut venta.Builder) {
    let pkg = builder.package(package);
}
#+end_example
